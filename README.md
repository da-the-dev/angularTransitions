# Transitions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

I was testing out what kind of transitions are possible, used [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beautiful-page-transitions-in-angular/) as a reference.

## Building & running
If you want to build and/or run this thing for whatever reason, use `ng build` to build or use `ng serve` to start a server then go to [localhost:4200](localhost:4200) to view the website.
